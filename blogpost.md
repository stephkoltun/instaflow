#Brainstorming
I had a number of ideas for this spatially-oriented data art project that I wanted to test before narrowing it down to one. 

#Invisible Cities
An installation of platonic oversized forms create an abstract environment to hear Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities". As with many museum and gallery experiences, an indivdual audio tour device is available. Audio clips play based on an individual's position relative to others, the objects and empty space. Each 'hot spot' is associated with different clips from the text. Depending on how each person circulates through the environment and their latent interation with others, each could hear potentially a different ordering of clips. With this lack of specific order, each listener constructs their own invisible city from Calvino's text. The video below demonstrates the concept from a planametric view.

##Trace-Route Search Enginge
Building on an earlier project in Understanding Networks, I was interested in exposing the physical locations of IP address hops that every request makes before a webpage is delievered. Rather than enter a particular website address into the browser bar, this is taken as an input, and each hop is shown with the corresponding Google Streetview. As one individual continues to use this service for navigating to all websites
Notes for further exploration: how could this incorporate a map view? Could a browser extension be a way to implement the same experinece but for clicking on links on a page, rather than directly inputting a destination?

#Broadcast 2.0
Broadcast is a project I keep coming back to and am never satisfied with. The basic premise is to use proximity between two individuals to prompt the swapping of whatever music they're currently listening to. Although I've developed a prototype of it before, I looked at how the interactions would change without a map view. 

#Instagram-Directions Mashup
The idea I developed furthest in terms of technical implementation combined Instagram and directions-mapping. Given two locations, rather than returning the most optimal route, directions are routed to a number of popular Instagram destinations within a set distance from the start and end points. I think the idea can  

The method of picking which instagram points

In further development, I'd like to incorporate more branch of points along the original route. Rather than source additional destinations based on their proximity to the start and end, if an originating route is longer than a certain distance, intermediate points could be determined to find other locations.
